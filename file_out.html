<html><p>The <b style="color:#ff0000">term</b> `` <b style="color:#ff0000">computational</b> <b style="color:#ff0000">neuroscience</b> '' was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz , who organized a conference , held in 1985 in Carmel , California , at the request of the <b style="color:#ff0000">Systems</b> Development <b style="color:#ff0000">Foundation</b> to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a <b style="color:#ff0000">variety</b> of names , such as neural <b style="color:#ff0000">modeling</b> , <b style="color:#ff0000">brain</b> <b style="color:#ff0000">theory</b> and neural networks . </p><p>The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book Computational <b style="color:#ff0000">Neuroscience</b> . </p><p>[ 2 ] The first open international meeting focused on Computational <b style="color:#ff0000">Neuroscience</b> was organized by <b style="color:#ff0000">James</b> M. Bower and <b style="color:#ff0000">John</b> Miller in San Francisco , California in 1989 and has continued each year since as the annual CNS meeting [ 3 ] The first graduate educational <b style="color:#ff0000">program</b> in <b style="color:#ff0000">computational</b> <b style="color:#ff0000">neuroscience</b> was organized as the Computational and Neural <b style="color:#ff0000">Systems</b> Ph.D. <b style="color:#ff0000">program</b> at the California Institute of <b style="color:#ff0000">Technology</b> in 1985 . </p><p>The early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as Louis Lapicque , Hodgkin & Huxley , Hubel & Wiesel , and <b style="color:#ff0000">David</b> Marr , to name a few . </p><p>Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire <b style="color:#ff0000">model</b> of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907 ; [ 4 ] this <b style="color:#ff0000">model</b> is still one of the most popular <b style="color:#ff0000">models</b> in <b style="color:#ff0000">computational</b> <b style="color:#ff0000">neuroscience</b> for both cellular and neural networks <b style="color:#ff0000">studies</b> , as well as in mathematical <b style="color:#ff0000">neuroscience</b> because of its simplicity ( see the recent review article published recently for the centenary of Lapicque 's original paper ) . </p><p>[ 5 ] About 40 years later , Hodgkin & Huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical <b style="color:#ff0000">model</b> of the action potential . </p><p>Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex , the first cortical <b style="color:#ff0000">area</b> to <b style="color:#ff0000">process</b> <b style="color:#ff0000">information</b> coming from the retina , have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns . </p><p>[ 6 ] <b style="color:#ff0000">David</b> Marr 's work focused on the interactions between neurons , suggesting <b style="color:#ff0000">computational</b> approaches to the <b style="color:#ff0000">study</b> of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact , store , <b style="color:#ff0000">process</b> , and transmit <b style="color:#ff0000">information</b> . </p><p>Computational <b style="color:#ff0000">modeling</b> of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of Wilfrid Rall , with the first multicompartmental <b style="color:#ff0000">model</b> using cable <b style="color:#ff0000">theory</b> . </p></html>
